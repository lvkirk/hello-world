# hello-world
just getting started
Hi im Ron C. I want to learn to code. I would prefer to learn on my own and without having to pay. Im 56 years of age and i only want to learn for my own benefit. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and i work in the convention industry. I only have very basic computer skills, however im up for the challenge. I would appreciate any advice, help, or mentorship I can get. Maybe someone could help me and i could pay it forward later. Anyhow im all about learning, chatting, and meeting new people.
